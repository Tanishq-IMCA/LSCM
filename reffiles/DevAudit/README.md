## About This Project

RepoSight is an AI-powered web application designed to analyze a developer's GitHub repositories to provide comprehensive codebase health reports and professional skill assessments. The software offers an out-of-the-box onboarding experience to understand the user's background, experience level, and technical expertise. Users provide their GitHub username for public repositories or an optional Personal Access Token (PAT) for private repository scanning. By leveraging deterministic static analysis paired with AI insights, the system identifies bugs, security vulnerabilities, architectural patterns, and code quality metrics. It then cross-references the developer's stated skills against actual code complexity to provide honest, experience-level-aware feedback.

## Design Philosophy

**Splash Screen & First Impression:** A bold, beautiful landing page with glassmorphism design, commanding taglines, and a modern command-line-inspired aesthetic. The interface feels like a developer tool — minimal, powerful, and inviting.

**Out-of-the-Box Onboarding:** Once authenticated, users are guided through a structured flow: name, experience level (student/junior/senior), tech stack selection, resume upload or manual skill input, and GitHub connection. This single flow captures everything needed for contextual analysis.

**Beautiful, Responsive Results:** Scan progress streams in real-time via WebSockets. Results display with animated charts, code snippet highlights, and clear severity levels. The UI choreography (powered by Framer Motion) makes complex data feel snappy and intuitive.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Next.js 14+** with React 18+ for blazing-fast SPA transitions and server-side rendering
- **TanStack Query** for seamless frontend-backend synchronization without page refreshes
- **Framer Motion** for cinematic element animations, scan progress visualizations, and interactive result displays
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first, responsive styling with glassmorphism design tokens
- **TypeScript** for type-safe component and API contracts

### Backend Stack
- **FastAPI** (Python 3.10+) for async, high-performance API handling
- **PostgreSQL** for structured data storage (users, repos, scan results, skill assessments)
- **Redis** (via Upstash for Replit) for caching and Celery task brokering
- **Celery** for asynchronous, long-running analysis tasks (repo scanning, AI processing)
- **WebSockets** for real-time streaming of scan progress and results to the frontend

### AI & Analysis Pipeline
- **Stage 1 (Deterministic):** Semgrep for security scanning, Bandit/Ruff/ESLint for code quality, radon for complexity metrics — all fast, deterministic, no LLM cost
- **Stage 2 (AI-Augmented):** Claude (via API) for plain-English summaries, skill-vs-code cross-referencing, and general insights — applied sparingly to curated findings

### Deployment
- **Replit** for full-stack hosting (Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database, Celery workers)
- **Upstash Redis** for serverless Redis (Celery task broker)
- **GitHub API** for repository data ingestion

## User Flow

### 1. Landing (Splash Screen)
User arrives at a beautiful, bold landing page with glassmorphism design. Tagline: "We refuse to build software that's ordinary" or similar commanding statement. Command-line-inspired aesthetic with subtle animations. Single call-to-action: "Begin Audit."

### 2. Authentication
GitHub OAuth login (or PAT fallback for advanced users). Minimal, clean auth modal.

### 3. Onboarding (Out-of-the-Box Experience)
Sequential, guided experience:
- **Name & Experience Level:** Student / Junior / Senior (determines tone and expectations for results)
- **Tech Stack Selection:** Checkboxes for languages, frameworks, tools (Python, React, Node, Rust, etc.)
- **Skills Input:** Resume upload (PDF/DOCX) or manual text entry of claimed skills
- **GitHub Connection:** Username (for public repos) or optional PAT (for private repos)

### 4. Scan Submission
User reviews their inputs and submits. Frontend immediately shows a progress screen with real-time updates via WebSocket.

### 5. Async Analysis (Backend)
- Celery worker fetches repos from GitHub API
- Runs deterministic security and quality scans (Semgrep, Bandit, ESLint, radon)
- Streams intermediate results back to frontend via WebSocket
- Curates findings into JSON structure
- (Optional) Sends curated findings + resume to Claude for AI-augmented insights and skill cross-reference
- Stores final report in PostgreSQL

### 6. Results Display (Frontend)
Real-time animated results display:
- Repository overview (language distribution, LOC, commit history)
- Security findings (critical, high, medium, low — color-coded)
- Code quality issues and refactoring suggestions
- Complexity metrics and architectural patterns
- **Skill Assessment:** "Your resume claims React expertise; your code shows intermediate-level patterns. Here's where to level up."
- Export option (PDF or JSON)

## Setup & Execution

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- Python 3.10+
- Git
- GitHub account (for OAuth)
- Replit account with Postgres database provisioned
- Upstash Redis account (free tier sufficient)

### Environment Variables
Create `.env.local` (frontend) and `.env` (backend):

**Frontend:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_oauth_client_id
```

**Backend:**
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@replit-postgres-host/reposight
REDIS_URL=redis://default:upstash-token@upstash-redis-host:port
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_pat
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key (for Claude via API)
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_for_jwt
```

### Local Development on Replit

1. **Create a new Replit project** and choose "Import from GitHub" or start blank.
2. **Provision PostgreSQL** via Replit's database panel (automatic environment variables).
3. **Add Upstash Redis** URL to `.env`.
4. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
# Frontend (Next.js)
cd frontend
npm install

# Backend (FastAPI + Celery)
cd ../backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Run development servers:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend (FastAPI)
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2: Celery Worker
cd backend
celery -A core.tasks worker --loglevel=info

# Terminal 3: Frontend (Next.js)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

6. **Access the app** at `http://localhost:3000`

### Deployment on Replit
- **Frontend:** Deploy as a Reserved VM on Replit with `npm run build && npm start`
- **Backend + Celery:** Deploy as a separate Reserved VM with the same startup commands
- **Database:** Use Replit's managed PostgreSQL
- **Redis:** Use Upstash's free tier, connection string in environment

## Key Features

- **No Rate Limit Friction:** Celery + Redis keep long-running scans off the critical path; frontend stays responsive
- **Honest Skill Assessment:** Actual code complexity vs. claimed skills — no BS, data-driven insights
- **Deterministic + AI Hybrid:** Fast, verifiable static analysis augmented with human-like explanations
- **Beautiful UX:** Glassmorphism, real-time animations, responsive design
- **Privacy-Conscious:** PAT is encrypted at rest (KMS-style vault for production); snippets fetched on-demand from GitHub, not stored
- **Portfolio-Grade Architecture:** Full-stack async pipeline with WebSockets, Celery workers, and a modern SPA — resume-worthy engineering

## Security & Privacy

- GitHub PATs are encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption
- Code snippets are fetched on-demand from GitHub's raw content API, never persisted to the database
- User data is scoped to their own repositories and skill inputs
- All API calls are authenticated via GitHub OAuth or PAT scope validation

## Future Enhancements

- LinkedIn skill pulling (if API access becomes available)
- Team-based audits (scan multiple developers' repos in one report)
- Custom linting rule templates
- Integration with hiring platforms (share audit reports with recruiters)
- Automated PR suggestions based on findings
